# Project Shift Coding Challenge

First of all, this isn't a pass/fail challenge. Some may find this difficult and others may find it rudimentary given that it is very basic JavaScript. Either way it will give us great topic for conversation during the interview. We don't expect candidates to already know how to code, but we are interested to see what (if any) previous experience you have. All that to say, if you're scared of this challenge, you shoudn't be. If you feel like you're above this challenge, don't worry, we have plenty of ways to challenge you.
